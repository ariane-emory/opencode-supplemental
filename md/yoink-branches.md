#### The order is important for these ones since the last one is a patch to reconcile the prior two:

fix/nonfatal-missing-key-commands
feat/keybindable-commands
fix/reconcile-keybindable-commands-warnings (this one it meant to make the prior two work properly together)

#### And finally, finish up with this branch:

feat/base-one-rebrand

(skip any branches on lines which are commented out with a "#" charcter)
