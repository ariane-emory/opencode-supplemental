First, fetch origin and then check out the latest integration branch. The integration branches all have the date/time in their branch names, so it should be easy for you to figure out which one is latest. If that branch already exists locally, do a 'git pull' just to make sure it's up to date.

Then, proceed to install it so I can run it globally from any directory.
