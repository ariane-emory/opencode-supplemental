This branch took the first steps in rebranding the name of the product from OpenCode/opencode/OPENCODE to BaseOne/base-one/BASE_ONE. So far, all we have changed is the title that appears on the startup screen. You can compare this branch with the dev branch to see what was changed.

Lets make a plan to more thoroughly rebrand the project to this new name. What steps would you recommend me take to complete the rebranding?

@rekram1-node Any thoughts on this one? Seems like a pretty simple and helpful change to me. 

 I've been running it locally for several days and its been working great for me.
