$ARGUMENTS

We MUST revise the installation instructions to prevent this mistake from occuring again before we proceed with the installation.

The installation instructions I gave you came from a custom command for opencode located at: ~/.config/opencode/command/install-latest-opencode-integration-branch--pickle.md. You encountered some difficulties or made some mistakes while following these instructions that gave us some trouble achieving our goal.

Using what you have learned during our session today, can you think of ways that these installation instructions could be improved to prevent us from encountering the same problems next time? We don't want to make the same mistakes the next time we do this.

If you can think of any improvements, please edit the ~/.config/opencode/command/install-opencode-integration-build-pickle.md file to include them.
