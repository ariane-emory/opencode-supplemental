description: Find and plan to eliminate code smells.
agent: build

---

Analyze the code and find opportunities to refactor to improve its maintainability, or for other 'code smells' we could eliminate. Think the refactoring through thoroughly and break the refactoring plan down into small steps to produce a detailed, step-by-step plan for implementing the refactoring.

The changes MUST NOT affect the program's behavior or appearance and MUST NOT add any new files.

Group the plan's steps into "phases" that can be completed independantly. The code MUST build correctly and all tests MUST pass after each phase. 

$ARGUMENTS

Proceed with the implemention of all phases of the plan. The code MUST build correctly and all tests MUST pass afterwards.
