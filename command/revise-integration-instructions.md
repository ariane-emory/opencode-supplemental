description: Revise integration instructions.
agent: build

The integration instructions I just gave you came from these files: 

~/.config/opencode/md/integrate-branches--prologue.md
~/.config/opencode/md/integrate-branches--body.md
~/.config/opencode/md/integrate-branches--epilogue.md
(which all get included by a custom command at ~/.config/opencode/command/integrate-branches.md)

You encountered some difficulties or made some mistakes while following these instructions that gave us some trouble achieving our goal. $ARGUMENTS

Using what you have learned during our session today, can you think of ways that these instructions could be improved to help you avoid making the same mistakes and encountering the same problems next time we perform this procedure?

Remember that we're using the fish shell, NOT bash, when writing commands.

If you can think of any improvements to the instructions that would be helpful in he future, please edit the instruction files to include them.
