description: Add more  tests for untested code.
agent: build

---

Systematically analyze the codebase to find any code that doesn't have adequate test coverage. Once you've identified the untested code, come up with a detailed, step-by-step plan to create tests for this untested code. Group the plan's steps into "phases". The code MUST build correctly and all tests MUST pass after each phase.

$ARGUMENTS

Proceed with the implemention of all phases of the plan. The code MUST build correctly and all tests MUST pass afterwards.
