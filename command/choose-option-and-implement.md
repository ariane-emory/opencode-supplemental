Let's go with option $ARGUMENTS, that one sounds good to me.

Proceed with implementing option $ARGUMENTS.

Do not make any changes unrelated to implementing this option.

The code MUST build correctly and all tests (except the enterprise tests, you can ignore those) MUST pass after wards.

Think carefully about whether the changes necessitate re-generating the TypeScript SDK, and if so be sure to perform this step. Don't worry about the Python SDK yet, we can deal with that later on.
