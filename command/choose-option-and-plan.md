Let's go with option $ARGUMENTS, that one sounds good to me.

Think the changes required to implement option $ARGUMENTS through thoroughly and break the changes down into small steps in order to produce a detailed, step-by-step plan for resolving the issue. Group the plan's steps into "phases". The code MUST build correctly and all tests (except the enterprise tests, you can ignore those) MUST pass after each phase in the plan. 

Do not make any changes unrelated to the changes that are required to resolve the isue.

Think carefully about whether the changes necessitate re-generating the TypeScript SDK, and if so be sure to include this step in your plan. Don't worry about the Python SDK yet, we can deal with that later on.

Once you've come up with your plan, submit it to me for approval.
